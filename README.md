| [Review and Catalog Website for E-liquids for E-cigarettes](https://github.com) | A review and catalog website for e-liquids designed for e-cigarette users. The platform features a full CRUD-enabled backend, allowing for dynamic content management. Users can browse a wide range of e-liquids, leave detailed reviews, and rate products on a scale from 1 to 5.                        | Django, React, SCSS        |
| [Anomaly Seeking game](https://github.com)                                      | A first-person anomaly seeking game set in a looping house. Players must identify and report subtle environmental changesâ€”like missing or moved objectsâ€”using a tablet interface. Randomized anomalies and a hidden instability system create tense, replayable gameplay focused on observation and memory. | C#                         |
| [Deep Learning-Based Frame Interpolation App](https://github.com/Stimm147/frame-interpolation)               | A first-person anomaly seeking game set in a looping house. Players must identify and report subtle environmental changesâ€”like missing or moved objectsâ€”using a tablet interface. Randomized anomalies and a hidden instability system create tense, replayable gameplay focused on observation and memory. | Python                     |
